# Adding-Context

iPython notebook that counts word frequencies, comparing the ratio of the word `privacy` to the total number of words in a corpus. The complete version is found here: http://mediagestalt.com/context.html

This repo presents an abridged sample of text analysis using Python. The data is from the Canadian House of Commons Parliamentary debates, published as Hansard.

Due to file size restrictions, only a portion of the corpus is available in this repo. This includes transcripts for the years 2006 to 2014 inclusive. The missing data consists not of new files, but the same files arranged differently, representing the 39th through the 41st sittings of Parliament. Visit the above webpage for the complete analysis.

This repo can also be viewed in iPython notebook format at: http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/mediagestalt/Adding-Context. Download the directory and explore the data in your own way.
